Added "In Pet Battle" to bar group Show When options on General tab, allowing Raven to be used to track pet battle-related buffs and debuffs.
Fixed issue with "Zoom Icons" option for rectangular icons with Masque enabled (this combination was greyed out in r380).
Added option in custom bar groups to desaturate icon for ready bars, supporting a somewhat different look for cooldowns in icon configurations.

Added option to zoom rectangular icons rather than stretch them. For many width-to-height ratios, this results in better looking icons that are still quite identifiable.

Added special case to debuff tracker for Agony so that both time and count can be refreshed correctly in a macro that changes target.
Fixed issue with spell color sometimes not being correct for bars in debuff tracker created with an AOE spell or a macro that changes target.
Remove Corruption when not in combat if warlock has talent Absolute Corruption.
Remove trackers for first Soul Effigy when spell is recast and replacement Soul Effigy is summoned.

Fix issue with notification bars not appearing.
Changes to custom sort order fixed now to update in profile.
