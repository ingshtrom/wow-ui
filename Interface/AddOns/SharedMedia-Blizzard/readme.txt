README:
--------


All of the included textures can be found in the game already.  These are in addition to the media
that LibSharedMedia-3.0 already pulls from the game.  SharedMedia-Blizzard exists to give you a
wider choice of game textures/sounds, without overflowing the basic library with stuff that many
users won't use/care about.



The only textures included in the Backgrounds folder are those that needed to be edited.

The Elite and Rare textures were taken from Discord Art.  Loz or someone else photoshopped them 
out of the unit frames.

The two endcaps are only found in the game for the left side (the game flips them for your action
bars).  So I flipped them and included the right side versions so you can use both.

The PlayerActionBarAlt texture is only present as 3 segments (unlike the other spell bar textures,
which also have a "complete" version).  So I photoshopped the 3 sections into one texture.



If there are any textures here that you do not wish to use, you may simply comment out their
respective lines by putting two dashes (--) at the beginning of the line, or by removing the line
completely.  This way, your menu in-game won't be so long to go through.

If you have suggestions on any sounds to add to the list, please create a ticket at my portal on 
WoWInterface to suggest it.  http://seerah.wowinterface.com
